For now it's best to start with a fresh Jekyll installation and then install the theme and then transfer over any old files (posts, images, etc) from your old site.

* Install Jekyll and create a new project
* Git clone this repo, cd into the new Jekyll directory and run `bundle install --binstubs --path=vendor` to install the required dependencies.
