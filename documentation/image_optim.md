### IMAGE_OPTIM PLUGIN

A custom plugin I've created to integrate the awesome image_optim tool with Jekyll so that all of your images will be losslessly optimized.

* Custom [image_optim](https://github.com/chrisanthropic/image_optim-jekyll-plugin) plugin will optimize all images in the /images folder and any subdirectories
  * Uses the original [image_optim](https://github.com/toy/image_optim)
* Cache file is created on the first run so that only updated/new images are optimized
